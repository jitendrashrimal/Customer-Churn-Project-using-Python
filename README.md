# Customer-Churn-Project-using-Python
In this project, Visualized trends and relationships in the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight churn-driving factors for stakeholders. Presented findings with clear, actionable insights and data-driven recommendations for reducing churn to key business decision-makers.

Project Title: 
Telecom Customer Churn Prediction using Python

Key Responsibilities & Achievements:
Performed data cleaning and preprocessing on telecom datasets to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data using Pandas and NumPy.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key factors influencing customer churn, such as contract types, payment methods, and service usage patterns.
Built and evaluated machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost) to predict customer churn with high accuracy.
Visualized trends and relationships in the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight churn-driving factors for stakeholders.
Enhanced model performance through hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering, improving predictive power.
Presented findings with clear, actionable insights and data-driven recommendations for reducing churn to key business decision-makers.
